# Cheatsets

A collection of cheatsets I like to keep on my desktop. These are commands I use on a not daily basis. To not have to browse through my shell history over and over again, I worte them down.

## Usage

I recommend sometinhg like [msee](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msee) if you like to see them in your shell.

    npm install -g msee

Then clone them to a place where you can find them

    git clone https://github.com/fabianmoronzirfas/cheatsets.git ~/bin/Cheatsets/

Watch them in your shell or just open them with your favorite markdown viewer.

    msee ~/bin/Cheatsets/git.md
